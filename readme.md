# Project Notes
I've created this project in order to study nested anonymous classes and lambda.  
I used the following articles as guidance for my learning:
- [Dev Media - Nested Classes](https://www.devmedia.com.br/padrao-de-projeto-factory-method-em-java/26348)
- [Oracle - Nested Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/nested.html#:~:text=A%20nested%20class%20is%20a,members%20of%20the%20enclosing%20class.)
